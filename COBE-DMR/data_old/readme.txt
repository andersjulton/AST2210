0 - infinite determinant
1 - quick S_cov, non-recursive C_ell (a few lines and circles going down from the left)
2 - slow S_cov, recursive C_ell (3 lines in a corner)
3 - quick S_cov, recursive C_ell (3 lines in a corner)
4 - slow S_cov, non-recursive C_ell (same as 1, but just parts of it at the top)
5 - quick S_Cov, recursive C_ell (sucess... ish)
